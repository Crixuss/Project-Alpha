1.Create scatter plot showing the relationship of military bases per state and frequency of UFO sightings per state
2.Analysis of the population of locations where UFO sightings occur. Break down the location populations size (we will bucket the populations of locations into different ranges, ex. Small, Medium, Large) Bar chart or cat/whisker plot
3.Create a pie chart of the shapes of the UFO sightings
4.Bar Chart of the duration of sightings per state (median duration on x-axis and state on the x-axis)
5.Heatmap of all UFO sightings in the US
6.Line chart of UFO sightings per year/per decade, layer in some notable events (eg. Moon Landing)
